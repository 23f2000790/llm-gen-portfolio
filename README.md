# Vivek's Portfolio

## Summary
This project is a personal portfolio website for Vivek, designed to showcase his skills, projects, and provide a way for potential employers or collaborators to get in touch. It is a clean, modern, and responsive single-page application built using standard web technologies.

## Setup
This is a static site, meaning it doesn't require any special backend server or complex setup. To view the portfolio:

1.  **Clone the repository:** If this were hosted on GitHub, you would clone it. For local viewing, simply download the `index.html` and `style.css` files.
2.  **Open `index.html`:** Navigate to the folder where you've saved the files and open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. That's it!

## Code Explanation
*   **`index.html`**: This is the main HTML file that structures the content of the portfolio. It includes sections for an introduction (hero), about me, skills, projects, and a contact form. It links to the `style.css` file for styling.
*   **`style.css`**: This CSS file contains all the styling rules for the portfolio. It defines the layout, colors, typography, responsiveness, and visual presentation of all the HTML elements.
